# Data- Science- Portfolio

### A Portfolio of my Data Science Projects

This is the repository of the projects I worked on or currently working on for self-learning, solving interesting problems and for professional purposes. The projects are written in Python (Jupyter notebook). The goal of these projects is to use data science/ modeling techniques/ Machine learning algorithms for finding interesting results to solve business problems. A typical project consists of cleaning data, exploratory analysis, data preprocessing, visualization and building models. Click on the respective projects to see full analysis and code.

### Projects:

**Factors affecting  performance  of  students**

- Cross correlation analysis between performances and factors (academic, demographic and behavioral)
- Analyzed data and predicted class using tree-based models.
- Visualized the analyzed data using seaborn.
- Studied the affect of parameter tuning and its result in random forest classier.
- Keywords: Pandas, seaborn, Random Forest classifier, Python

**Predicting Sale Price of used cars**

•	Analyzed the used car dataset to see the correlation between the top sold combinations.
•	Developed and compared the predictions of important features using different models.
•	Keywords- Linear regression, data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction

**Credit card fraud detection**

•	Created classifier for fraud detection compared the performance of different classifiers on imbalanced, under sampled and oversampled 
  dataset.
•	Used resampling techniques (under sampling/oversampling to overcome unbalanced dataset.
•	Evaluated model’s performance using various approaches (confusion metrics, ROC curve, Precision recall curve).
•	Keywords:  data analysis, feature engineering, under sampling, oversampling, tree based models, Keras, Neural network

 **Santander bank product recommendations**

- Used machine learning algorithms to predict which products their existing customers will use in the next month based on their past 
  behavior and that of similar customers.
- Scored top 25% position on competition.
- Keywords- Exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering.
