# Data- Science- Portfolio

### A Portfolio of my Data Science Projects

This is the repository of the projects I worked on or currently working on for self-learning, solving interesting problems and for professional purposes. The projects are written in Python (Jupyter notebook). The goal of these projects is to use data science/ modeling techniques/ Machine learning algorithms for finding interesting results to solve business problems. A typical project consists of cleaning data, exploratory analysis, data preprocessing, visualization and building models. Click on the respective projects to see full analysis and code.
